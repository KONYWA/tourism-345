            overview: "The Marangu Route, also known as the Coca-Cola Route, approaches Kilimanjaro from the southeast and is favored by many for being considered the easiest route on the mountain. The minimum duration for this route is five days, though the chances of successfully reaching the summit in that time are somewhat low. It is highly recommended to spend an extra acclimatization day to increase your chances of success. Marangu is unique in that it is the only route that offers sleeping huts in dormitory-style accommodations, providing more comfort than camping. You'll be picked up from the airport or your hotel in Arusha, and accommodation before the tour starts can be arranged for an additional cost.",
